## Lab Requirements (From NTU Cool)
```
====basic problem====

Please read some information about PWM techniques and applications in Internet
resources (such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation, 
https://electricalfundablog.com/pulse-width-modulation/, ...) and find an 
application that you are interested in.

And generate the PWM waveforms for the applications, which can be observed using
a logic analyzer.

Show some waveform observations in your Demo to TA.

=================

 

====option problem_A====

(a) Demo an input capture task using a timer.
And give some discussions in your report.

Hint: You can use the PWM waveform generated by the basic problem (see above) as
the input to this task.

Hint: Ref: https://community.st.com/t5/stm32-mcus/how-to-use-the-input-capture-feature/ta-p/704161

or

(b) Generate a complimentary PWM signals with deadtime insertion. Observe the 
waveforms with Logic Analyzer. And give some discussions in your report.

(Note: Due to the limitation of available of IO pins, IoT STM32L4 Discovery Board 
is not suitable to do this part. Please check TA for an STM32 Neucleus Board.)


===================

 


====option problem_B==== (optional personal report)

Students can choose content that is relevant  to the class of this week, less
repetitive with the assignment, and meaningful to conduct experiments on their
own, and write a report on the experimental content and results.
